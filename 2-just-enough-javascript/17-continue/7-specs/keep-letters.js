/* Challenge: write this program using `break` and `continue`

  a user can input a non-empty string and all characters which are not letters will be removed
    - given the user cancels, they will be prompted again
    - given the input is empty, they will be prompted again
    - given their input is valid, the loop will exit and the extra characters will be removed

  test cases:
    only letters:
      'JavaScript' -> 'JavaScript'
      'abc' -> 'abc'
      'heLLO' -> 'heLLO'
    only not-letters:
      '.(-).' -> ''
      '-=>|<=-' -> ''
      '. - ^ - .' -> ''
    mixed letters and not-letters:
      'hello world!' -> 'helloworld'
      'let input = ""' -> 'letinput'
